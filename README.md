### About us

On **March 8th, 2025,** Sleman and I (Robert Anthony Scianatico) founded SodiumNodes because of the fall of the company which we used to work in with SevenZero being the founder. GalaxyNodes.

Our motto, “The only element your server needs”, represents our ambition to provide **high-quality**, **high-performance servers** at the **lowest possible cost.** We understand how challenging it can be for people who are just getting started to rent a Minecraft server, and up to this day we have kept that in mind while pricing.

After experiencing other small hosting companies, we realized our mission: **to deliver the best possible experience to our customers, regardless of the challenges.** With over **three years of experience** in Minecraft servers and networking, I’ve gained the knowledge needed to manage a hosting company effectively. Running my own Minecraft network taught me the value of reliability and the flaws in free hosting services.

What motivates us most is customer confidence: **Positive reviews**, **constructive feedback**, **repeat business**, and **building relationships with our users**. When our customers trust us, it truly matters, and we strive to earn that trust with every service we provide.

We are committed to continuous improvement, dedicating our time, resources and energy to making SodiumNodes better each day.

### Christ’s impact on our company
When we mention SodiumNodes as being a “faith-driven company”, we express our faith in Jesus’ brutal death for us and his teachings being reliable. At SodiumNodes, we believe that Jesus is our Lord and saviour, or a prophet at the very least. We also closely follow his teachings, increasing honesty, kindness, and professionalism within our support and staff team.


We are SodiumNodes—the only element your server needs.
